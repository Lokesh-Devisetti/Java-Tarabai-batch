        <h1>Inline CSS</h1>
        <p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element</p>
     
     <h1>Internal CSS</h1>
     <p>An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</p>
    <h1>External CSS</h1>
    <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>
